INTRODUCTION

  The purpose of this project is to implement a simple console decompressor of archive file formats such as 'gzip', 'zlib'
and some others. 
  So far the program is capable of decompressing 'zlib' archives with .gz extension. Support of other archive
formats such as 'zlib' and 'tar' is expected to be added soon. Also a later version of the app may come with a graphic 
user interface.
