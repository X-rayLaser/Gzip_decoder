Gzip_decoder
============

INTRODUCTION

  The purpose of this project is to implement a simple console decompressor of archive file formats such as 'gzip', 'zlib'
and some others. 
  So far the program is capable of decompressing 'gzip' archives with .gz extension. Support of other archive
formats such as 'zlib' and 'tar' is expected to be added soon. Also a later version of the app may come with a graphic 
user interface.
  
  When the program is running it is asking to insert the full file name. Then the program decompress an archive file and puts it in the same directory containing an archive file. It is recommended to run the app from a command line because this way it is
possible to use copy/pasting to insert a file name. 
  
  Note, if you are working with file names containing cyrillic characters, it is required to set cmd font to be 'Lucida Console'. Otherwise cyrillic characters might not be displayed correctly while typing them.
